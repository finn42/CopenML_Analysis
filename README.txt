Repository of analysis scripts on the republished motion recordings collected from the audience of the Copenhagen MusicLab Experiment Concert. These files combine information in the participant details such as questionnaire results, location information, relationship information, and the reorganised motion recordings from both the MusicLab app and the AX3 sensors. 

Participants are identified across these files by a six character code. The first three characters specify the type of participant and informaiton available: A or B for in hall or remote, E or D or n for English Danish language or no questionnaire results, and QRSTU or V for the quality of motion recording avaiable for that participant. The last three digits express the participants unique numerical identifier. See the OSF repository for more complete information on the participant codes.
